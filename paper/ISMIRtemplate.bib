abstract = {This paper describes the design policy and specifications of the RWC Music Database, a music database (DB) that is available to researchers for common use and research purposes. Various commonly available DBs have been built in other research fields and have made a significant contribution to the research in those fields. The field of musical information processing, however, has lacked a commonly available music DB. We therefore built the RWC Music Database which contains four original DBs: the Popular Music Database (100 pieces), Royalty-Free Music Database (15 pieces), Classical Music Database (50 pieces), and Jazz Music Database (50 pieces). Each consists of originally-recorded music compact discs, standard MIDI files, and text files of lyrics. These DBs are now available in Japan at a cost equal to only duplication, shipping, and handling charges (virtually for free), and we plan to make them available outside Japan. We hope that our DB will encourage further advances in musical information processing research.},

abstract = {The Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) serves an essential function in the MIR com- munity, but researchers have noted that the anonymity of its datasets, while useful, has made it difficult to interpret the successes and failures of the algorithms. We use the results of the 2012 MIREX Structural Segmentation task, which was accompanied by anonymous ground truth, to conduct a meta-evaluation of the algorithms. We hope this demonstrates the benefits, to both the participants and evaluators of MIREX, of releasing more data in evaluation tasks.$\backslash$nOur aim is to learn more about the performance of the algorithms by studying how their success relates to prop- erties of the annotations and recordings. We find that some evaluation metrics are redundant, and that several algorithms do not adequately model the true number of segments in typical annotations We also use publicly available ground truth to identify many of the recordings in the MIREX test sets, allowing us to identify specific pieces on which algorithms generally performed poorly and to discover where the most improvement is needed.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel method for jointly extract-ing beats and downbeats from audio signals. A recurrent neural network operating directly on magnitude spectro-grams is used to model the metrical structure of the audio signals at multiple levels and provides an output feature that clearly distinguishes between beats and downbeats. A dynamic Bayesian network is then used to model bars of variable length and align the predicted beat and down-beat positions to the global best solution. We find that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of different musical genres and styles.},

@article{McFee2017,
abstract = {Music exhibits structure at multiple scales, ranging from motifs to large-scale functional components. When inferring the structure of a piece, different listeners may attend to different temporal scales, which can result in disagreements when they describe the same piece. In the field of music informatics research (MIR), it is common to use corpora annotated with structural boundaries at different levels. By quantifying disagreements between multiple annotators, previous research has yielded several insights relevant to the study of music cognition. First, annotators tend to agree when structural boundaries are ambiguous. Second, this ambiguity seems to depend on musical features, time scale, and genre. Furthermore, it is possible to tune current annotation evaluation metrics to better align with these perceptual differences. However, previous work has not directly analyzed the effects of hierarchical structure because the existing methods for comparing structural annotations are designed for “flat” descriptions, and do not readily generalize to hierarchical annotations. In this paper, we extend and generalize previous work on the evaluation of hierarchical descriptions of musical structure. We derive an evaluation metric which can compare hierarchical annotations holistically across multiple levels. Using this metric, we investigate inter-annotator agreement on the multilevel annotations of two different music corpora, investigate the influence of acoustic properties on hierarchical annotations, and evaluate existing hierarchical segmentation algorithms against the distribution of inter-annotator agreement.},
