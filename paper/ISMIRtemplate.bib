@article{Goto2002,
abstract = {This paper describes the design policy and specifications of the RWC Music Database, a music database (DB) that is available to researchers for common use and research purposes. Various commonly available DBs have been built in other research fields and have made a significant contribution to the research in those fields. The field of musical information processing, however, has lacked a commonly available music DB. We therefore built the RWC Music Database which contains four original DBs: the Popular Music Database (100 pieces), Royalty-Free Music Database (15 pieces), Classical Music Database (50 pieces), and Jazz Music Database (50 pieces). Each consists of originally-recorded music compact discs, standard MIDI files, and text files of lyrics. These DBs are now available in Japan at a cost equal to only duplication, shipping, and handling charges (virtually for free), and we plan to make them available outside Japan. We hope that our DB will encourage further advances in musical information processing research.},

@article{Bock2016,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel method for jointly extract-ing beats and downbeats from audio signals. A recurrent neural network operating directly on magnitude spectro-grams is used to model the metrical structure of the audio signals at multiple levels and provides an output feature that clearly distinguishes between beats and downbeats. A dynamic Bayesian network is then used to model bars of variable length and align the predicted beat and down-beat positions to the global best solution. We find that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of different musical genres and styles.},

@article{McFee2017,
abstract = {Music exhibits structure at multiple scales, ranging from motifs to large-scale functional components. When inferring the structure of a piece, different listeners may attend to different temporal scales, which can result in disagreements when they describe the same piece. In the field of music informatics research (MIR), it is common to use corpora annotated with structural boundaries at different levels. By quantifying disagreements between multiple annotators, previous research has yielded several insights relevant to the study of music cognition. First, annotators tend to agree when structural boundaries are ambiguous. Second, this ambiguity seems to depend on musical features, time scale, and genre. Furthermore, it is possible to tune current annotation evaluation metrics to better align with these perceptual differences. However, previous work has not directly analyzed the effects of hierarchical structure because the existing methods for comparing structural annotations are designed for “flat” descriptions, and do not readily generalize to hierarchical annotations. In this paper, we extend and generalize previous work on the evaluation of hierarchical descriptions of musical structure. We derive an evaluation metric which can compare hierarchical annotations holistically across multiple levels. Using this metric, we investigate inter-annotator agreement on the multilevel annotations of two different music corpora, investigate the influence of acoustic properties on hierarchical annotations, and evaluate existing hierarchical segmentation algorithms against the distribution of inter-annotator agreement.},
