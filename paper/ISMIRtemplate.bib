@article{Bock2016,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel method for jointly extract-ing beats and downbeats from audio signals. A recurrent neural network operating directly on magnitude spectro-grams is used to model the metrical structure of the audio signals at multiple levels and provides an output feature that clearly distinguishes between beats and downbeats. A dynamic Bayesian network is then used to model bars of variable length and align the predicted beat and down-beat positions to the global best solution. We find that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of different musical genres and styles.},
